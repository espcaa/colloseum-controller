What's colloseum? Simply the greatest smash-like tournament game ever, happening @highway (https://highway.hackclub.com), a hardware hackathon at github hq

## Wow look at it!!!!

## What is that, how does it works???

Based of an CH552G it can act as a usb keyboard so that your pc recognize it as a keyboard without any specific driver!
It uses quite a few techniques to bring down cost, everything is tht, the usb port is just a trace on the pcb, making it around 2-4$/board (hopefully)

## BOM

(prices for 1 unit, at 50 costs will go -50% thanks to lcsc)

| Name     | Units | Price       | LCSC Number
|----------|-----|------------|-------|
| CH552G    | 1  | 0.5575      | C111292 |
| 3mm led (any color) | 4 | 0.0228 | C2895458 |
| Resistors | 5 | 0.5 | NA |
| Button | 2 | 0.0466 | C22459507 |
| Joystick | 1 | 0.40 | C37323739 |
| PCB | 1 | 4.4 | NA |
| M3 Nut | 4 | 0.01 | C133377 |
| M3 Screw | 4 | .. | NA |

You also need some pla/petg/whatever to 3d print the case
The pcb can seem expensive but that's just the ENIG setup fee, we're at less than a dollar per pcb when ordering 50
