# The mysterious and very long (no) journal of the Colloseum controller

## Day 1 (of 2 :sob:)

I started researching parts, finished the schematic!

## Day 2 (also of 2 :sob:)

I finished the PCB wiring, started the case design and finished it! I don't exactly like it but i'll try to iterate over it later!
The pcb is at approx 3$/unit so that's really cool!
